        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>HackYourFuture is a not-for-profit coding school for people with limited access to education and the labor market. The majority of our students worldwide are refugees.</p>
        <h2>The program</h2>
        <p>We believe in a world in which education and quality jobs are accessible for all. This is why we have designed a free 34 week program for newcomers in tech.</p>
        <h2>The goal</h2>
        <p>After the program we support our students in finding high quality jobs. Our success criteria is not graduation from the course but employment in the tech industry.</p>
